# Measuring Fetal Heartbeat using MEMS microphone - USER guide

# Placing the Non invasive wearable device on the phantom
Ensure that the microphones are placed over the sillicone incisons on the phantom

All the ESP32s must be powered via USB C

# Simulating the audio signals 
Connect to both the audio exciter speakers via bluetooth

Play the corresponding heartbeat signals

# üë∂ Fetal Heartbeat Recording and Signal Processing with ESP32

This repository provides the tools and workflow to capture and process fetal heartbeat signals using an array of 4 ESP32 microcontrollers and MATLAB signal processing techniques.

## üöÄ Setup & Execution Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the Recorder Firmware
Flash the [`SD_card_Recorder.ino`](./SD_card_Recorder.ino) onto **each of the 4 ESP32 boards**:

## Example using Arduino IDE or platformio
## Make sure your ESP32 board and port are selected
Upload -> SD_card_Recorder.ino -> to all 4 ESP32s

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Audio Recording
Once uploaded:

Press the RESET button on each ESP32

This will start a 60-second audio recording

The audio is saved automatically to the SD card as a .wav file

üìÅ Files will be saved to the root of the SD card as:
recording_001, recording_002 etc

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve the Recordings
Remove the SD cards and collect the .wav files:

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Signal Processing in MATLAB
Open the MATLAB Live Script:
Signal Processing Framework.mlx

The script allows you to:

Upload the 4 ESP32 .wav recordings

Upload a reference fetal heartbeat signal

Perform signal alignment, enhancement, and attempt FHB isolation
